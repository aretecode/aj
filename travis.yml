# 1: This tells Travis CI it is a Node.js project, we need this to run our
#    packages.
# 2: It is possible to test your project on several versions of Node.js on each
#    run. Version 0.10 is the lastest stable release and is good enough for this
#    project.
# 3: Before Travis CI runs the "npm install" command it will run whatever we
#    specify here. Because we need the grunt-cli to be available so we can
#    start the unit tests we can instruct Travis CI to install it now.
